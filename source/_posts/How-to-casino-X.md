#  What are the New York Mets?

The New York Mets are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team based in the borough of Queens in New York City. They are a member of the National League East division.

Founded in 1962, the Mets were part of the original National League expansion. The team played its first game on April 10, 1962, against the Houston Colt .45s at the Polo Grounds. They won their first championship in 1969, led by pitcher Tom Seaver and hitters Nolan Ryan, Donn Clendenon, and Cleon Jones.

In 1973, the Mets moved to Shea Stadium, which they shared with the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). It was there that they became known as the "Miracle Mets" after they reached the World Series in 1969 and again in 1973, both times losing to the Baltimore Orioles. The Mets captured their first championship by defeating the heavily favored Boston Red Sox in five games in 1986. They also won championships in 2000 and 2015.

The Mets are owned by Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz through their company Sterling Equities. Jeff Wilpon, son of Fred Wilpon, is the club's chief operating officer.
