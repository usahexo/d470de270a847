The hotel is expected to make this announcement sometime next week, as gaming officials have already given the green light for the new casino.

This game is manufactured by a company called International Game Technology (IGT), which just happens to be the same company that supplies slot machines to casinos around the world, including those owned by Trump.

Could it be that Trump doesn't want to offer a game that could potentially lose him money? Or is there another reason why he's avoiding this particular game?

It's also possible that he knows the game isn't popular with players, and doesn't want it appearing at his casino. Whatever the reason may be, it's clear that Trump Hotel Las Vegas isn't featuring Cuzco Gold - and for good reason.
